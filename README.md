# Decentagram

## Overview
Decentagram is a decentralized version of Instagram built on the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging smart contracts to allow users to post images, like, and comment in a decentralized manner. This project demonstrates the power of blockchain technology in building social media platforms where users have control over their data.

## Features
- Post images with descriptions.
- Like and comment on posts.
- View posts in a decentralized feed.
- User authentication and profile management on the blockchain.

## Technology Stack
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: For smart contracts and decentralized application logic.
- **Truffle Suite**: Used for smart contract compilation, testing, and deployment.
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: Used for managing project dependencies and possibly for backend services.

## Installation and Setup
To set up and run Decentagram locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sherwinvishesh/Decentagram.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required npm packages:
   ```
   cd Decentagram
   npm install
   ```
3. **Compile Smart Contracts**
   Compile the smart contracts using Truffle:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```
4. **Deploy Smart Contracts**
   Deploy the contracts to a local Ethereum blockchain using Ganache (or to a testnet):
   ```
   truffle migrate
   ```
5. **Start the React App**
   Run the React application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing
